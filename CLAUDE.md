# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repository is

This checkout is `niilo/Vita3K` (`origin`). The code is upstream Vita3K
(`upstream` is `Vita3K/Vita3K`). `README.md` and the screenshots come from
Vita3K-Plus (nckstwrt/Vita3K-Plus): the merge `1f75257f` took only those
files, not the Plus code. So the README's per-game fixes, "Accurate Thread
Scheduling" and the "Page Table on Android" default are not in this code.
The Plus code is on `plus/all-enhancements` (read-only remote `plus`).

Unmerged Adreno work exists on `feat/ayaneo-pocket-s-performance`,
`feat/vulkan13-adreno` and `feat/vulkan-device-profiles`.

The Vulkan validation layer is on by default (`config.h:136`), and every APK
carries it (`android/prebuilt/`, packaged through `jniLibs`). Android loads
a layer packaged in the app's own APK for release and debug builds alike.
So Android builds probably run with validation on, which is much slower.
Check for "Enabling vulkan validation layers" in `vita3k.log`. Measure
speed with release APKs.

The parent file `../CLAUDE.md` describes a different fork (Vita3K Thor). Its
writing standard applies here. Its tools (`tools/mcp_server.py`,
`tools/debug_knowledge.py`, `reports/debug_knowledge.sqlite`, `.agents/skills/`)
do not exist in this checkout.

`AGENTS.md` points to this file and holds no rules of its own.
`docs/agents/` configures the engineering skills: issues are Markdown files
under `.scratch/<feature-slug>/`, and domain docs are `CONTEXT.md` and
`docs/adr/` when they exist.

## Containers (default on this Mac)

Use Apple's `container` CLI for Linux builds, tests, format and the Android
APK. `container/vita3k.sh` runs everything. The repo is mounted at `/src`,
so output lands in the normal `build/` folder on the host.

```sh
container/vita3k.sh build            # Linux build, preset container-linux
container/vita3k.sh test             # ctest; extra args go to ctest, e.g. -R mem
container/vita3k.sh format-check     # the same clang-format 22 check as CI
container/vita3k.sh format
container/vita3k.sh android          # debug APK, both ABIs: build/android-apk/app-reldebug.apk
container/vita3k.sh android release  # small APK, arm64 only, R8 on: build/android-apk/app-release.apk
container/vita3k.sh shell [android]  # interactive shell
container/vita3k.sh run <cmd...>     # any command in the Linux container
```

- `container/linux.Containerfile`: Fedora 44 arm64. Fedora is used because
  it ships Qt 6.11. Ubuntu 26.04 has only 6.10.
- `container/android.Containerfile`: Ubuntu 24.04 amd64, run through
  Rosetta, because the NDK has x86_64 Linux host tools only. Keep its
  `ANDROID_NDK_VERSION` equal to `ndkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle`.
- The reldebug APK is about 100 MB: R8 is off, so the Java code is about
  64 MB, and it has a second `libVita3K.so` for x86_64. The release APK has
  neither. `container/build-android.sh` holds both build modes.
- The image tag is a hash of the Containerfile. An edit to the file builds a
  new image on the next command.
- ccache, vcpkg binaries and the Gradle cache are kept in the volumes
  `vita3k-linux-ccache` and `vita3k-android-cache`
  (`container/vita3k.sh clean-cache` deletes them).
- `VITA3K_CONTAINER_CPUS` and `VITA3K_CONTAINER_MEMORY` (default 16G) set the
  container size. The container default of 1 GiB is too small to link.
- A container build cannot run the emulator with a GPU. Use a native macOS
  build (below) to run games.

## Build

After a clone or a branch change, update the submodules. Most dependencies
are submodules under `external/` (dynarmic, SDL, glslang, SPIRV-Cross, boost,
ffmpeg, googletest, and others).

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

CMake presets are named `<os>-<generator>-<compiler>`. Each one builds into
`build/<preset>`. Run `cmake --list-presets` to see the ones for this host.
The Qt frontend needs Qt 6.11 or newer. Set `Qt6_ROOT` if the system Qt is
older.

```sh
# macOS (this machine): brew install git cmake molten-vk openssl qt
cmake --preset macos-ninja
cmake --build build/macos-ninja --config RelWithDebInfo

# Linux
cmake --preset linux-ninja-clang
cmake --build build/linux-ninja-clang --config RelWithDebInfo

# Windows
set Qt6_ROOT=C:\Qt\6.11.0\msvc2022_64
cmake --preset windows-vs2022
cmake --build build/windows-vs2022 --config RelWithDebInfo
```

Android uses Gradle, with the native code built through CMake. It needs
`ANDROID_NDK_HOME`, `VCPKG_ROOT`, and the vcpkg manifest dependencies
(`vcpkg install --triplet arm64-android` from the repo root).

```sh
cd android && ./gradlew --stacktrace assembleReldebug
```

CI (`.github/workflows/c-cpp.yml`) builds through `.ci/build-desktop.sh
--preset <ci-preset> --config <config>` and `.ci/build-android.sh`.

## Tests

Tests use googletest and CTest. Two suites exist: `mem-tests`
(`vita3k/mem/tests/`) and `module-tests` (`vita3k/module/tests/`).

```sh
ctest --test-dir build/<preset> --build-config RelWithDebInfo --output-on-failure
ctest --test-dir build/<preset> --build-config RelWithDebInfo -R mem   # one suite
build/<preset>/bin/<config>/mem-tests --gtest_filter='Suite.Name'      # one test; binary path depends on generator
```

## Format

CI checks formatting with clang-format on `vita3k/` and `tools/`
(`.clang-format` at the root). Format before a commit:

```sh
./format.sh            # CLANG_FORMAT_BIN=<path> to pick a binary
```

## Architecture

The emulator is under `vita3k/`. Each subdirectory is a CMake static library
with `include/<name>/` and `src/`. The main pieces and how they connect:

- **`emuenv/`**: `EmuEnvState` holds the state of the whole emulator (memory,
  kernel, IO, renderer, display, audio, config). Most code takes it as the
  first argument.
- **`cpu/`**: guest ARM CPU through dynarmic (`dynarmic_cpu.cpp`).
- **`mem/`**: the guest address space, a large host reservation with a page
  allocator. Memory mapping modes (External Host, Page Table, Native Buffer,
  Double Buffer) decide how the GPU sees guest memory.
- **`kernel/`**: guest threads, sync objects, waits, callbacks, and the module
  loader.
- **`module/`** and **`modules/`**: high-level emulation (HLE) of Vita system
  libraries. `modules/` has one folder per Vita library (`SceGxm`,
  `SceAudio`, `SceIofilemgr`, and about 150 more). A function is written as
  `EXPORT(ret, name, args...)` (`module/include/module/module.h`), and its
  NID is registered in `nids/include/nids/nids.inc` as
  `NID(name, 0x...)`. A new export needs both. Some libraries are loaded as
  the game's or firmware's own LLE (real code) modules instead;
  `modules/module_parent.cpp` handles loading and import binding.
- **`gxm/`** and **`renderer/`**: `SceGxm` calls build renderer commands
  (`renderer/include/renderer/commands.h`, `CommandOpcode`). A separate
  renderer thread runs them. Backends are `renderer/src/vulkan/` (main;
  `surface_cache.cpp` maps guest render targets and textures to host images)
  and `renderer/src/gl/`. `renderer/src/texture/` decodes Vita texture
  formats.
- **`shader/`**: translates GXP shader programs (USSE instructions) to SPIR-V
  (`spirv_recompiler.cpp`, `translator/`), and then to GLSL for OpenGL
  through SPIRV-Cross.
- **`io/`**: the virtual filesystem (`ux0:`, `app0:`, `vs0:`, and so on)
  mapped to host folders.
- **`display/`**: vblank timing and frame presentation.
- **`gui-qt/`**: the Qt desktop frontend. **`overlay/`**: the in-game
  overlay. **`android/jni/`** plus `android/app/` (Kotlin): the Android
  frontend.
- **`interface.cpp`** and **`main.cpp`**: boot flow (install or load an app,
  load modules, start the main thread).

`tools/gen-modules` generates module stubs. `tools/native-tool` and
`tools/usse-decoder-gen` are developer tools. `vita3k/shaders-builtin/` holds
the host shaders that the renderer needs at run time.
